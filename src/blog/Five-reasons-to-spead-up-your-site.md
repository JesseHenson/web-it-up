# 5 Reasons to Speed Up your Website

> We've all been there... "Hey look at this sick website I just made for my Photography business... Wait, it'll load... stupid wifi... I get no service here... man... OH!!! Here it is.

> Oh the embarassment! The horror! Don't let this happen to you"

This has happened to all of us... but it doesn't have to. With modern tech stacks we can add speed, flexibility and allow our users to get the best experience possible.

As a business person... how does that effect you? Great Question! Let's get into it.

# The Down and Dirty of It

## 1. Google Ranking

- Google has indicated that your speed, and your overall user experience does effect your ranking (SEO)
  - Which makes sense... if you were a search engine you'd want people using you to find the easiest answers to their questions, right?

## 2. UX is super important

- Beyond keeping google happy, you'll keep your customers happy.
  - In an age of instant gratification, no one wants to wait a few seconds for your site to open up all of it's wonders.
  - Sure... user experience embodies a lot more than just your performance... there's a lot to think about, but this new techstack and modern workflow helps make it the best it can be.

## 3. Get new customers

- Current customers might have time and enough brand loyalty to wait... but new customers... fo'get about it.
  - People will wait an average of 3 seconds for your site to open... they might have a bad connection... they might have no service... but your site is getting dinged regardless.
  - Why make them wait... why not impress them with how fast your site pops up, with it's wonderful images, animations and user expereince.

## 4. Get ahead of the curve

- The new technicologies of website development are here to stay. The old days of WordPress and Squarespace are on the downhill slide.
  - JAMStack is a cutting edge technology stack that offers gargantuan flexibility, speed, usability and... did I mention speed?
  - Gatsby is leading the way... it's built on modern and well established frameworks like... react, redux, graphQL and SharpImage (technical gargin for it's not goin anywhere)
  - Out of the box themes and starters, give you a great performance on lighthouse audits (google's developer audit report)... Anyone with some knowledge of react can use a starter and get it linked to your CMS.
  - CMS's are changing too... are you ready? Traditional CMS's use servers and are more structured by nature. New headless CMS's offer flexibility... speed and more functionality overall.

## 5. Provide easier workflows

- Along with the modernized speed and optimization you get flexibility and great workflows.
  - You can use a headless cms... any API that you need (hello integrations)... even just markdown (a word doc... with a boost)

## For More fun Facts... technical gargin... details on the reasons... Keep on readin'

### Technical (TL;DR)

Our workflow allows us to give you the best of two very different worlds. Single page application, static web pages. Here's a sinario... your starting a business, woah... that's way out there... You want a website, but you don't have a lot a capital yet.

> Let's make a cheap website on SquareSpace, free to make, cheap to host.

That makes sense... no one wants to have to pay that much and hey... it's low barrier to entry.

Five. Years. Later.

> I need my site (my great, branded, well-established site) to add ecommerce... well maybe I'll just do a plug-in or shopify or some other application... cool... I have added functionality... wait I want to add a portal for my clients too... Oh wow, now this is getting kind of messy. And why's it so slow.

### Let's back up!

You want a site now that you can change forever... you're going to establish the heck out of that site... your going to brand it... put your going make your mark all over it... let's make it something that lasts.

Incoming!!!

### React! Gatsby! JAMStack!

> I want an app. I don't want to pay for a mobile app though. Let's use React. Well ok. But now we're in two places... three if you include our e-commerce... four if you include our blog. And if we rebuild in react... forget it... to load that first page is insane... 10... 15 seconds... No Thanks!

### Cut to...

Gatsby! I want to build an easy, fast site, but I want to be able to add stuff later... E-commerce, blog, maybe even some app functionality.

### Gatsby Saves the day!

I can build a blog that uses simple markdown to create new pages... I can build an ecommerce site that has ultimate flexibility and branding potential. I can even build an entire web application within the same site...

> But won't that take forever to load???

Nope! Gatsby loads all of those things seperately... every page seperately. So I can add a ton of functionality without a long load at the beginning.

It also connects to many sources using integrated GraphQL sourcing. I can use a GraphQL query to grab the info from within my project. Then use it anywhere in my project.

This gives me the ability to add the information from multiple headless CMSs, markdown files, JSON files and more.

Then I can add data Connections... Apollo servers, Prisma servers, Node servers, API's, SQL Data... You name we can connect it. Gatsby is literally a hub for connecting all these modern technologies.

### Last and very important. It's static.

Why do you care?

#### C...D...N's

You live in say... America... but you have potential clients in Australia... you have one server (one place sending out your site)... hello, slow! They're waiting a while for your site. Anyone from Australia... is pulling out their hair waiting to see your awesome products.

#### Introducing Content Dilivery Networks (CDN's)

> I'm in Australia... I'm ahead of the curve... I'm gonna be the first to see your product. You've been ahead of the curve for a while, your using a CDN. I'm the first to look it up. So I have to wait a little while. Luckily you used Gatsby and your page is blazing fast; all the images are lazy loaded and the page is only loading what's necessary. Maybe a second a half... it does have to travel the world, you know.

> Surprise! My buddy looks it up. He waited less than half a second. What! How could this be? Well my friend your static files are all cached... their kept right there, near that area of Australia. So when my buddy looks up your site he sees your awesome product even faster.

With all of these improvements to your site, you'll be able to get more clients, get on the top of more searches, improve your reach and most importantly keep your users (clients/ customers) happy
